SS Belgian
The SS Belgian was a 5,287 ton steamship which was built in 1919, sold in 1934 becoming Amelia Lauro, seized in 1940 and renamed Empire Activity and sunk by a German U-boat in 1941.


History
Belgian was built by Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Ltd, Wallsend and launched on 29 August 1919, being completed in October 1919. From 1919 to 1934 Belgian was owned by the Leyland Line. In 1934, she was sold to Achille Lauro, and renamed Amelia Lauro.
On 7 March 1940, Amelia Lauro was damaged by German bombing at 52°55′N 02°19′E en route from Newcastle upon Tyne to Piombino laden with coal. She was set on fire and the crew anchored her, then abandoned her. The SS Titania rescued 37 of the crew, and the sloops Pintail and Londonderry assisted. Amelia Lauro was escorted to Immingham with her superstructure burnt out. One crew member was killed outright and three were wounded. One of the wounded crewmen later died from his injuries. In an expression of gratitude, Lauro Lines owner Achille Lauro donated £26. 5s to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in appreciation of assistance rendered by the Great Yarmouth and Gorleston lifeboat in bringing 29 crew to shore. Permission was given for temporary repairs to be carried out.
As a consequence of Italy's declaration of war on 10 June 1940, Amelia Lauro was seized as a prize of war. The seizure was ratified by the prize court on 4 May 1941. Amelia Lauro was taken over by the Ministry of War Transport, being renamed Empire Activity. Galbraith, Pembroke & Co were appointed managers. On 27 June 1941, Empire Activity was torpedoed by U-96 off Newfoundland at 49°30′38″N 53°51′30″W, 1 nautical mile south of the Peckford Reef. She was en route from Botwood to the United Kingdom laden with zinc concentrates.
