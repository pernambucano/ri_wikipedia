80.002
The 80.002 was a combined assault rifle and grenade launcher prototype based on the AK-74 platform. The weapon was developed at TsNIITochMash by Yu.V. Minaev, V.I. Chelikin, and G.A. Yanov between 1975 and 1979. The main difference from the Kalashnikov is the presence of two adjacent barrels of 5.45 mm and 12.7 mm respectively. The thickness of the receiver was double that of an AK-74. The 80.002 was not accepted for service.
